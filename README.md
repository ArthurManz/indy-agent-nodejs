# Indy Agent NodeJS

This repository is based out of the [Indy-Agent] repository.
The main focus is to build a re-usable NPM package to allow everybody
build their own agents in a easy way and match the Agent-2-Agent 
communication protocol.

For more information please see the [agent-2-agent docs]


## Sample Application based on reference implementation

> WIP: Show how to use this NPM module, implementing the existing
NodeJS reference implementation
